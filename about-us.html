                            <summary>
                                Vishnu founded AlphaStreet because he believes that to be a good investor, you don’t have to learn the hard way by losing a sizeable chunk of cash, attend a top business school, or be a stock wizard. Drawing from his experience with all the above, he’s made it his mission to create a way for individual investors to make informed stock decisions with a community of support behind them. Thus sparing them the hassles of losing one’s hard-earned savings and/or going to business school. (Although as an alum, Vishnu is pretty partial to the Chicago Booth School of Business.)<br/><br/>

                                After researching other ventures in the “shared economy,” Vishnu designed AlphaStreet as a complete online ecosystem that seeks to demystify investing and enable people to build wealth by helping each other.

                                Vishnu has the standard gobs of management experience – 21 years in IT, Finance, and Retail. Because he has that area fully covered, he decided that AlphaStreet staff would consist of folks without the burden of his background - those who want to invest but do it sparingly or those who want to but are intimidated because of the complexity and time required. Establishing the perfect team to design the perfect solution for common man has freed a good 30-minutes of downtime each week for Vishnu. During that time, he can be found indulging in his favorite activities: hiking, reading and hanging out with his family.

                                RC is Alpha Street’s true Renaissance man. Among his laundry list of talents and expertise are 10 years providing investor relations and investment management with financial specialties such as: quarterly earnings analysis, earnings and analyst call summaries, CEO/CFO interviews, and SEC reports.<br/><br/>

RC is an active quiz league participant – mostly in business and general knowledge. So, go ahead and ask him which country has a flag that’s not rectangular. He may just know. (Hint: it’s near Tibet, but it’s not Tibet.) He’s also a news junkie, particularly obsessed with business, politics and sports topics.<br/><br/>

“One Up on Wall Street” by Peter Lynch and “Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham are two books RC cites as having a lasting impact on his life, as well as everything ever written by John Grisham.<br/>

Among RC’s other passions include: cars, gaming, science fiction, and digital photography.

                                Stuart is a self-professed stock market novice who hopes he’s able to make online investing so simple that even he can understand it. He thoroughly enjoys writing code, particularly when he’s able to do so from scratch. Open source software provides the variety and freedom he enjoys the most.<br/><br/>

Before joining the AlphaStreet team, Stuart spent the past ten years as the Senior Developer and Project Manager at MythTV creating one of the most popular open source media applications. During that time, he also worked as a freelance developer where he handled projects ranging from tailored open source software to the development of new applications.
<br/><br/>
In his off-work hours, Stuart enjoys hiking and growing his own food. He’s also teaching himself a few foreign languages.<br/>
